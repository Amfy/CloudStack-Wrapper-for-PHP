##Instructions
* Requirements: PHP5+ (der!), cURL module enabled (but it will output URLs without it) and a CloudStack API Key/Secret + Target URL
* See the example.php provided for information

*Need a CloudStack Account? If you contact me on Twitter. I will give you a free trial on Ninefold's Cloud Compute. Just send me a mention and I'll flick the details back via DM.*
##Why I made this...

This was initially created to interface with the Ninefold (http://ninefold.com) Cloud Compute API. It is based on CloudStack and thus in *theory* and  barring any weird code changes between the releases I coded this in and the upcoming releases of CloudStack, should function correctly across the board. It was made to assist in my development of applications specific to Ninefold, easier to develop... and I was bored and I enjoy this stuff.

##Any issues?

If you encounter any issues feel free to contact me and I'll do my best to assist. If you wish to improve on this, please do as I learn from seeing code updated and evolved for the better. I am definitely not the best at this and it was a little hobby of mine that helped me make a bunch of apps that interfaced with Ninefold (such as my Ninefold for iOS [unreleased]).

But officially...
 
###NO SUPPORT, GUARANTEES OR WARRANTY OFFERED WITH THIS CODE. USE AT OWN RISK.

##More about me...
I work for Ninefold (Cloud Computing Provider) as a Customer Support Technical Lead/Web Producer. When I am not working away on Technical Issues or Website anomalies, I dabble exclusively in PHP for my side projects. You will also see me tweeting random goodness day-to-day on Twitter on my handle @augrunt.
